# NetLogo matrix extension

This package contains the NetLogo matrix extension, which provides support for a new datatype (mathematical "matrix" objects) and associated operations (like matrix multiplication) in NetLogo. 

## Using

The matrix extension is pre-installed in NetLogo. For instructions on using it in your model, or for more information about NetLogo extensions, see the NetLogo User Manual.

## Building

Run `make`.

If compilation succeeds, `matrix.jar` will be created.

## Credits

The matrix extension was originally written by Forrest Stonedahl, with significant contributions from Charles Staelin (in particular, the forecast, regression and map primitives).

The matrix extension uses (and is distributed with) the Jama matrix library (Jama-1.0.3.jar, http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/), which has been released into the public domain.
